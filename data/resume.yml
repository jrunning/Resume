    I solve tough problems, without creating new ones, by applying a broad
    skillset developed through constant iteration and passion for the craft of
    web development.

      A flawless back-end isn't worth building if the user experience is
      frustrating and inconsistent. Modern tools and methodology let me put the
      user first as a rule, not an exception.

      Expertise in Ruby and Ruby on Rails lets me do great work, but also tells
      me when they're not the best tools for the job, and my diverse background
      gives me the ability to pick up the tools I don't yet know, quickly.

      Writing and speaking clearly about complex and subtle ideas is essential
      to being an effective team member, as is recognizing my teammates'
      strengths as well as opportunities to share my own skills and knowledge.

      I built SAFE, a Rails application that ensures administrators of company
      systems and facilities are notified and take appropriate action upon the
      end of employees' and contractors' employment. Its features include:

      - Retrieving and classifying "termination" records from H.R.'s
        Oracle database of tens of thousands of workers.

      - Routing and scheduling email notifications, reminders and escalations
        according to user-defined rules.

      - Asynchronously processing uploaded CSV files containing account records
        and matching them to H.R. records. Records are matched by
        user-configured fields and, in the absence of an exact match, close
        matches (selected by a "fuzzy matching" routine implemented with Sphinx)
        are presented to the user for confirmation.

      - A front-end using Backbone.js and Bootstrap, with a focus on usability
        and responsiveness (both challenges when presenting hundreds of records
        and complex configuration options to the user).

      - Designed and implemented a registration app for merchant services
        clients of [Tag Creative Studio]. The five-step wizard had more than 70
        interdependent fields and strict validation on the front- and back-end.
        tags: [ Ruby on Rails, jQuery, MySQL ]

      - Implemented from a precise specification a Node.js application for
        initializing, managing and communicating with other applications as
        directed by remote clients using JSON commands over a socket interface.
        tags: [ Node.js ]

      - Prototyped a web front-end and Node.js back-end for a Redis-backed
        English–Spanish translation database for [Componica].
        tags: [ Node.js, Redis ]

      - Designed and prototyped a social networking and live chat product in
        Ruby on Rails, backed by MySQL and Redis.

      - Developed and maintained large, public-facing web applications like
        DIYSEO (now [UpCity]) and e-commerce sites like [VetRxDirect] in Ruby
        on Rails and PHP.

      - Designed and implemented a Ruby client for a complex third-party API
        which gathered search engine data for DIYSEO.

      - Profiled and optimized complex queries on databases with hundreds of
        millions of records.

      - Worked directly with clients for whom an hour's downtime equaled
        thousands of dollars' lost revenue.

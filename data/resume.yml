    I solve tough problems by applying a broad skillset developed through more
    than a decade of passion for the craft of software engineering and web
    development.

      A diverse background gives me the ability to choose the right tool for
      any job, be it a classic CRUD app, an API-driven single-page app,
      something in the middle or something else entirely. Broad expertise lets
      me iterate---and pick up any skill---rapidly and consistently.

      An application isn't worth building if the user experience is frustrating
      and inconsistent. An eye for UX and mastery of modern tools and best
      practices enable me to put user experience and engagement first as a
      rule, not an exception.

      Writing and speaking clearly about complex and subtle ideas is key to my
      effectiveness as a team player, as is recognizing my teammates' strengths
      and seeking out opportunities to share skills and knowledge through
      mentorship and pair programming.

      Infrastructure automation leader Chef is an engineering-driven company
      that embraces agile methodology, kanban, and pair programming. There I
      contributed to some of Chef's most crucial user-facing software:

          I joined the Chef Analytics team to help turn a Ruby on Rails and
          AngularJS prototype into a shipped product on a tight deadline.
          Subsequently I worked closely with product managers and designers
          to refine functionality, build new features in React, and execute a
          UX-driven redesign.

          I championed best practices and empowered the team as principal
          maintainer of a Grunt- and Webpack-based build-and-test workflow. I
          also aided the implementation of the Rails back-end through technical
          guidance and pair programming.

          On the Workflow Pool team I delivered customer-driven enhancements
          and fixes for Chef's core products and workflow tools. I wrote
          comprehensive RSpec tests to not only cover new code but also to
          improve coverage and maintainability of existing code.

          I implemented UX enhancements and bug fixes for the web-based
          infrastructure management console Chef Manage using Ruby on Rails
          and Backbone.js, with comprehensive tests in RSpec and Mocha.

      I built a Rails application that notifies administrators of company
      systems and facilities when a worker's employment ends and ensures that
      they take appropriate action. Its features include:

      - Retrieving and classifying "termination" records from H.R.'s
        Oracle database of tens of thousands of workers.

      - Routing and scheduling email notifications, reminders and escalations
        according to user-defined rules.

      - Processing uploaded CSV data and matching it to H.R. records by
        user-configured fields or, in the absence of an exact match, via
        "fuzzy" matching implemented in Sphinx.

      - A fast and usable Backbone.js front-end for managing hundreds or
        thousands of records and complex configuration options.

          Designed and implemented a registration app for merchant services
          clients of [Tag Creative Studio](http://tagcreativestudio.com/). The
          five-step wizard had more than 70 interdependent fields and strict
          validation on the front- and back-end.

          Implemented, from a precise specification, a Node.js application

          interface.

      - Developed and maintained large, public-facing web applications like
        DIYSEO (now [UpCity]) and e-commerce sites like [VetRxDirect] in Ruby
        on Rails and PHP.

      - Designed and implemented a Ruby client for a complex third-party API
        which gathered search engine data for DIYSEO.

      - Profiled and optimized complex queries on databases with hundreds of
        millions of records.

      - Worked directly with clients for whom an hour's downtime equaled
        thousands of dollars' lost revenue.
